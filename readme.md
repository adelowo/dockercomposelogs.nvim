## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements

- Neovim ( a recent version )
- Properly installed docker environment on your machine.
  - `docker` command must be available

## üì¶ Installation

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
  {
    "adelowo/dockercomposelogs.nvim",
    config = function()
      require("dockercomposelogs").setup({})
    end,
    event = "VeryLazy",
    dependencies = {
      "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    },
  },
